# Blog Topic Generator

## Description:
This Blog Topic Generator is a project from https://codecademy.org, named 'Mixed Messages'.

The prompt of the project is to build a message generator program. Every time a user runs the program, they should get a new, randomized output.

With this, I opted to create a Blog Topic Generator for a data blog that spits out random content ideas related to data topics.

## Installation:

In order to use the program, you will need to have Node.js installed.

[Go here to install Node.js.](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## How to Use:

After downloading Node.js, you can download the script file of this project named 'main.js'.

Then, using your Terminal or command line tool, enter "node path-of-file" to run the script and get a random content idea.

For example:

> node /Users/johndoe/Downloads/blog-topic-generator/main.js

## New Features List:

Potential things to add are:

- More content headline templates
- More seed keyword data for more choices
